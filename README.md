# excel-challenge-Module 1 Challenge
Goal: Organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Modified and analyzed a sample crowdfunding project database containing 1,000 entries using Excel.

Used conditional formatting to color code cells in the Outcome column based on campaign status (successful, failed, canceled, or live).

Created a new column called Percent Funded to determine how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal and used conditional formatting to color code cells in the Percent Funded column based on the three-color scale.

Created a new column called Average Donation to find how much each project backer paid on average.

Split the Category and Sub-Category column into two new columns using formulas.

Created a pivot table to analyze the initial worksheet and count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or live per category, and a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country based on the table.

Created a pivot table to analyze the initial sheet and count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or live per sub-category, and a stacked-column pivot chart that can be filtered by country and parent category based on the table.

Converted the dates in the deadline and launched_at columns to Excel's date format using formulas.

Created a pivot table and pivot-chart line graph to visualize outcomes based on launch date.

Created a report in Microsoft Word, answering questions about the data and its limitations, and suggesting other possible tables and/or graphs to create.

Created a table and corresponding graph showing the percentage of projects that are successful, failed, and canceled based on their crowdfunding goal using the COUNTIFS() formula.

Created a summary statistics table for the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns, including mean, median, minimum, maximum, variance, and standard deviation.

Used the data to determine whether the mean or median better summarizes the data and if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns.
